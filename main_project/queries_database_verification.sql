-- COMP353 Main Project - Summer 2025
-- Database Application System for Montr√©al Volleyball Club (MVC)
-- DATABASE VERIFICATION & ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS
-- 
-- This file contains database verification queries and administrative operations
-- for the main project which extends the warm-up project with advanced functionalities.
-- 
-- Contents:
-- - Administrative database cleanup operations
-- - Database verification queries
-- - System health and data integrity checks
-- - Table count verification
--
-- Project Requirements:
-- - Supports members aged 11+ (Minor: 11-17, Major: 18+)
-- - Annual fees: $100 (Minor), $200 (Major)
-- - Team formations for games and training sessions
-- - Automated email notifications for weekly schedules
-- - Gender-separated teams with specific volleyball positions
-- - Multi-location club management with head/branch structure
-- ==========================================================================
-- ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS - Database Maintenance and Cleanup
-- These operations help maintain database integrity and remove unused data
-- ==========================================================================
-- ==========================================================================
-- ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS - Database Cleanup
-- Administrative cleanup operation that removes:
-- - Locations with no assigned club members
-- - Locations with no assigned personnel  
-- - Maintains referential integrity by deleting in proper order
-- Important for database maintenance and resource optimization
-- ==========================================================================
-- Temporarily disable safe update mode for administrative operations
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
-- Delete ClubMembers first due to FK constraints (should be none for empty locations)
