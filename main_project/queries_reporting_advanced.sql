--  12. Location training/game session statistics report
--  13. Active members never assigned to formations
--  14. Active major members who started as minors
--  15. Active members only assigned as setters
--  16. Active members assigned to ALL required roles
--  17. Family members who are head coaches at same location
--  18. Active members who never lost a game
--  19. Volunteer personnel who are family members of minor members
--  20. Trigger demonstrations
--  21. Integrity constraint demonstrations
--  22. Email generation and logging system
--
-- Project Requirements:
-- - Supports members aged 11+ (Minor: 11-17, Major: 18+)
-- - Annual fees: $100 (Minor), $200 (Major)
-- - Team formations for games and training sessions

-- Query #20: Trigger demonstrations 
-- This query demonstrates trigger functionality by showing email logs
-- that would be generated automatically by triggers when certain events occur
-- The trigger should automatically log emails when:
-- 1. New members are added to formations
-- 2. Payment reminders are needed
-- 3. Schedule changes are made
-- 4. Member status changes occur
-- 5. Formation updates are made
