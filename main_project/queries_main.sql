--  11. Inactive members with multiple location history
--  12. Location training/game session statistics report
--  13. Active members never assigned to formations
--  14. Active major members who started as minors
--  15. Active members only assigned as setters
--
-- Project Requirements:
-- - Supports members aged 11+ (Minor: 11-17, Major: 18+)
-- - Annual fees: $100 (Minor), $200 (Major)
-- - Team formations for games and training sessions
